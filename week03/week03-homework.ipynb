This can make us feel like slaves to the process. But today's verse reminds us that we are adopted as God’s children. He has not given us a spirit of fear, but a spirit of love and a sound mind. As we face the tedious and often frustrating task of data cleaning and preparation, we can trust that we have the wisdom and patience to bring order out of chaos. How can you approach this week's data wrangling challenge with a spirit of confidence, knowing that God has equipped you for the task? Please answer with a few sentences (or more!).\n",
