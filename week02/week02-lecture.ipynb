    "### **Understanding Python Namespaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a ***namespace*** refers to a container that holds a mapping between names (identifiers) and objects. It ensures that names are unique and prevents naming conflicts. Python has several types of namespaces, each with a different scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Built-in Namespace**\n",
    "   - Contains names like `len()`, `print()`, and `int`.\n",
    "   - Created when the Python interpreter starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Global Namespace**\n",
    "   - Contains names defined at the top-level of a module or script.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Local Namespace**\n",

    "#### **LEGB Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python resolves names using the **LEGB** rule, which stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **L**ocal — Names assigned within a function.\n",
    "- **E**nclosing — Names in enclosing functions (nested functions).\n",

    "\n",
    "NumPy is ***the*** foundational open-source Python library for scientific computing, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions. It enables fast, optimized numerical operations, used extensively in fields like physics, engineering, finance, and data science. Key features include its powerful ndarray object, which allows for efficient storage and manipulation of homogeneous data, and its support for vectorized operations that replace slow Python loops with optimized C code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Features and Functionality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N-dimensional Arrays (`ndarray`):** This is the core data structure in NumPy, representing a values of the same type.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Functions:** A wide range of mathematical functions, including trigonometric, statistical, linear algebra, and Fourier transform operations.\n",
    "- **Vectorization:** NumPy is capable of performing operations on entire arrays without explicit Python loops, leading to faster more concise code.\n",
    "- **Broadcasting:** A mechanism that allows operations on arrays of different shapes.\n",
    "- **Interoperability:** NumPy serves as an interoperability layer, allowing different array computation libraries to work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using NumPy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The widely accepted way to import NumPy into a Python script is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how I will use it throughout the course. Anytime you see the prefix `np` it is refering to the top-level namespace of the NumPy package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Creating Arrays**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several NumPy methods/functions to create NumPy arrays rather than using the Python built-in containers. Some of the more common ways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `np.array()`\n",
    "- `np.zeros()`\n",

    "- **Array vs. Array:** If you have two arrays, `A` and `B`, both of shape `(m, n)`, then `A + B` will result in a new array `C` where `C[i, j] = A[i, j] + B[i, j]` for all `i` from `0 to m-1` and `j` from `0 to n-1`.\n",
    "- **Array vs. Scalar (Broadcasting):** If you have an array `A` and a scalar `s`, then `A + s` results in a new array where `s` is added to every element of `A`. NumPy achieves this by \"broadcasting\" the scalar to match the shape of the array.\n",

This is a core reason why NumPy is so powerful for tasks involving large datasets and complex mathematical computations.\n",

    "##### Key Aggregation Functions | Methods\n",
