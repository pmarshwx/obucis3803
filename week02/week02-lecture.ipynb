    "### **Understanding Python Namespaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a ***namespace*** refers to a container that holds a mapping between names (identifiers) and objects. It ensures that names are unique and prevents naming conflicts. Python has several types of namespaces, each with a different scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Built-in Namespace**\n",
    "   - Contains names like `len()`, `print()`, and `int`.\n",
    "   - Created when the Python interpreter starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Global Namespace**\n",
    "   - Contains names defined at the top-level of a module or script.\n",
    "   - Created when a module is loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Local Namespace**\n",
    "   - Contains names defined inside a function.\n",
    "   - Created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **LEGB Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python resolves names using the **LEGB** rule, which stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **L**ocal — Names assigned within a function.\n",
    "- **E**nclosing — Names in enclosing functions (nested functions).\n",
    "- **G**lobal — Names at the module level.\n",
    "- **B**uilt-in — Names in the built-in namespace."
